Module 15
**File Location ** The key files for this assignment index.html and app.js can be found in the main folder of the repository and in the static/js subfolder respectively.

**Syntax Sources ** I did struggle with this assignment quite a bit. So I had to work with learning assistants for several parts of the app.js syntax.

The following website was used to figure out how to fix the marker colors: https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/

All of the remaining code was self-generated or was copied and altered from class material.
